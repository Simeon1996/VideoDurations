# VideoDurations
Peter watches videos every day. Once he wanted to calculate how many time he spends watching videos. He extracted a list of all videos he watched but he was unable to sum their durations because they were in format hours:minutes. Write a program to help Peter sum the durations of the videos he watched and print them in format hours:minutes (where minutes should be in the range 0...59).

Input
The input data should be read from the console. It consists of several input lines, each holding a video duration in format hours:minutes. At the last line the string "End" stays to indicate the end of the movie durations list.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
Print at the console the sum of the durations of all videos in format hours:minutes. The minutes should always be in two digits format (from "00" to "59").
